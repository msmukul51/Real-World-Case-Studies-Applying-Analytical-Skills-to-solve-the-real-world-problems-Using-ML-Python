But I know she was studying that pattern,\n","and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\n","Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be.

He laughed a little the other day,\n","and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.\n","I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\n","BECAUSE of the wall-paper--he would make fun of me. He might even want\n","to take me away.\n","I don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week\n","more, and I think that will be enough.\n","I'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it\n","is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the\n","daytime.\n","In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\n","There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow\n","all over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried\n","conscientiously.\n","It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all\n","the yellow things I ever saw--not beautiful ones like buttercups, but\n","old foul, bad yellow things.\n","But there is something else about that paper--the smell! I noticed it\n","the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\n","not bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows\n","are open or not, the smell is here.\n","It creeps all over the house.\n","I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in\n","the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\n","It gets into my hair.\n","Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise\n","it--there is that smell!\n","Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,\n","to find what it smelled like.\n","It is not bad--at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most\n","enduring odor I ever met.\n","In this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it\n","hanging over me.\n","It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\n","house--to reach the smell.\n","But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\n","is the COLOR of the paper! A yellow smell.\n","But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not ALIVE!\n","She tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent! But I said it\n","was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down\n","again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner--I would\n","call when I woke.\n","So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,\n","and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the\n","canvas mattress we found on it.\n","We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\n","I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\n","How those children did tear about here!\n","This bedstead is fairly gnawed!\n","But I must get to work.\n","I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\n","I don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till\n","John comes.\n","I want to astonish him.\n","I've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\n","does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\n","But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\n","This bed will NOT move!\n","I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\n","bit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.\n","Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor.\n","It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\n","heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\n","derision!\n","I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\n","window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\n","try.\n","Besides I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\n","like that is improper and might be misconstrued.\n","I don't like to LOOK out of the windows even--there are so many of those\n","creeping women, and they creep so fast.\n","I wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did?\n","But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don't get ME\n","out in the road there!\n","And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and\n","said it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it of course, and\n","came in. He stopped short by the door.\n","\"What is the matter?\" he cried. \"For God's sake, what are you doing!\"\n","I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\n","\"I've got out at last,\" said I, \"in spite of you and Jane. And I've\n","pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!\"\n","Now why should that man have fainted?

interesting to watch developments; but i sleep a good deal in the\n","daytime\n","in the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing\n","there are always new shoots on the fungus and new shades of yellow\n","all over it\n","i cannot keep count of them though i have tried\n","conscientiously\n","it is the strangest yellow that wallpaper\n","it makes me think of all\n","the yellow things i ever sawnot beautiful ones like buttercups but\n","old foul bad yellow things\n","but there is something else about that paperthe smell\n","i noticed it\n","the moment we came into the room but with so much air and sun it was\n","not bad\n","now we have had a week of fog and rain and whether the windows\n","are open or not the smell is here\n","it creeps all over the house\n","i find it hovering in the diningroom skulking in the parlor hiding in\n","the hall lying in wait for me on the stairs\n","it gets into my hair\n","even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise\n","itthere is that smell\n","such a peculiar odor too\n","i have spent hours in trying to analyze it\n","to find what it smelled like\n","it is not badat first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most\n","enduring odor i ever met\n","in this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it\n","hanging over me\n","it used to disturb me at first\n","i thought seriously of burning the\n","houseto reach the smell\n","but now i am used to it\n","the only thing i can think of that it is like\n","is the color of the paper\n","a yellow smell\n","but i am here and no person touches this paper but menot alive\n","she tried to get me out of the roomit was too patent\n","but i said it\n","was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down\n","again and sleep all i could; and not to wake me even for dinneri would\n","call when i woke\n","so now she is gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone\n","and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down with the\n","canvas mattress we found on it\n","we shall sleep downstairs tonight and take the boat home tomorrow\n","i quite enjoy the room now it is bare again\n","how those children did tear about here\n","this bedstead is fairly gnawed\n","but i must get to work\n","i have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path\n","i don't want to go out and i don't want to have anybody come in till\n","john comes\n","i want to astonish him\n","i've got a rope up here that even jennie did not find\n","if that woman\n","does get out and tries to get away i can tie her\n","but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on\n","this bed will not move\n","i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i\n","bit off a little piece at one cornerbut it hurt my teeth\n","then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor\n","it sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it\n","all those strangled\n","heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\n","derision\n","i am getting angry enough to do something desperate\n","to jump out of the\n","window would be admirable exercise but the bars are too strong even to\n","try\n","besides i wouldn't do it\n","of course not\n","i know well enough that a step\n","like that is improper and might be misconstrued\n","i don't like to look out of the windows eventhere are so many of those\n","creeping women and they creep so fast\n","i wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as i did?\n","but i am securely fastened now by my wellhidden ropeyou don't get me\n","out in the road there\n","and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and\n","said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of course and\n","came in\n","he stopped short by the door\n","what is the matter? he cried\n","for god's sake what are you doing\n","i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder\n","i've got out at last said i in spite of you and jane\n","and i've\n","pulled off most of the paper so you can't put me back\n","now why should that man have fainted? but he did and right across my\n","path by the
